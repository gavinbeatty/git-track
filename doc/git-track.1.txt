NAME
-----
git-track - set up a local branch to track a remote branch


SYNOPSIS
--------
*git track* [*-v*] [*-n*] [*-f*] [*-b* '<remote_branch>'] ['<remote>' ['<local_branch>']]
*git track* [*-v*] [*-n*] *-d* '<local_branch>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
A simple shell script to ease the unnecessarily complex task of tracking a
branch.


OPTIONS
-------
*-v*::
    Print the git commands before executing them.

*-n*::
    Don't run any of the git commands. Only print them, as in *-v*.

*-f*::
    Don\'t do any checks on whether '<local_branch>' is tracking a branch already
    or that '<remote_branch>' exists.

*-b* '<remote_branch>'::
    Don\'t reuse '<local_branch>' for the remote branch and use '<remote_branch>'.

*-d*::
    Stop '<local_branch>' from tracking anything.

`<remote>`::
    The remote where the branch you want to track exists.

`<local_branch>`::
    The local branch that will track the remote. If none given,
    use \`git symbolic-ref HEAD\`.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
0 on success and non-zero on failure.
