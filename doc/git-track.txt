GIT-TRACK(1)                                                      GIT-TRACK(1)



NAME
       git-track - set up a local branch to track a remote branch

SYNOPSIS
       git track [OPTIONS] [<remote>] git track [OPTIONS] -l <local_branch> -d

DESCRIPTION
       A simple shell script to ease the unnecessarily complex task of
       tracking a branch.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
           Print the git commands before executing them.

       -n, --dry-run
           Don’t run any of the git commands. Only print them, as in -v.

       -f, --force
           Don’t do any checks on whether <local_branch> is tracking a branch
           already or that <remote_branch> exists.

       -r, --remote-branch <remote_branch>
           Don’t reuse <local_branch> for the remote branch and use
           <remote_branch>.

       -l, --local-branch <local_branch>
           The local branch that will track the remote. If none given, use
           `git symbolic-ref HEAD\`.

       -d, --delete
           Stop <local_branch> from tracking anything.

       <remote>
           The remote where the branch you want to track exists.

EXIT STATUS
       0 on success and non-zero on failure.
